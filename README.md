# Day By Day Ohio

The [Day By Day Ohio Family Literacy Calendar](https://www.daybydayoh.org) is a website for families with young children. It features a perpetual calendar with songs, activities, book suggestions, and videos to support school readiness every day of the year.
 

A service of the [State Library of Ohio](https://library.ohio.gov/) in collaboration with [Ohio Ready to Read](https://www.ohreadytoread.org/), the Day By Day Ohio Family Literacy Calendar also includes literacy and health information and an Ohio public library locator map. It is available anytime, anywhere and requires just internet access and a computer, smartphone, or mobile device.
 

The Day By Day Ohio Family Literacy Calendar was built from code shared by the South Carolina State Library, creator of the original Day by Day Family Literacy Activity Calendar, made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](http://www.imls.gov/).

The South Carolina State Library made the DayByDay website files available for customization by other states. The State Library of Ohio has customized the original and converted it into a static website using [httrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack) and other tools. Others are welcome to further customize this version for their own purposes.
